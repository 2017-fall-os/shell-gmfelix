Welcome to my Operating Systems lab, simulating a shell!

This program is meant to simulate typing commands into a working shell, exhaustive functions are missing, but this shell is able to,
given a string of console input:
  -Parse the string and run simple commands (e.g. /bin/ls or ls, any will work just fine)
  -Pipe input from a command to another command (e.g. /bin/ls | /bin/sort -r OR ls | sort -r, any will work fine)
  -Run background tasks (e.g. find /etc -print & ls)
  -Change the current working directory of the shell (e.g. cd ..)
In order to run the shell, please download the files listed in this directory and simply type "Make run", if you want to run after the
compilation is over, or "Make" if you only desire to compile the files.
Once the shell is running, you will be prompted with a "$" sign, indicating the shell is ready to take whatever input the user wants to
execute.
If you wish to exit the shell, simply type "exit" and the shell will terminate on it's own.

Thank you for using my lab and have a great day!
